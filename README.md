🤖 Synaptica - AI Agent Marketplace
A decentralized marketplace for AI agents built on Avalanche blockchain, featuring NFT-based ownership, secure authentication, and interactive chat interfaces.

What is Synaptica?
Synaptica is a decentralized web application that lets users create, own, buy, sell, and interact with AI agents as NFTs on the Avalanche blockchain. It combines blockchain technology, secure wallet authentication, and interactive AI chat interfaces to create a marketplace for digital agents.

2. AI Agent Creation & Minting
Create custom AI agents: name, description, avatar image, system prompt
Mint agents as ERC-721 NFTs on Avalanche Fuji testnet
Pay AVAX for gas fees
Store agent metadata on IPFS for decentralization
3. Marketplace for AI Agents
List agents for sale, set price in AVAX
Browse all available agents with metadata, price, seller info
